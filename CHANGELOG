	* v0.99g

	Moved core source files into src/core
	Makefile now compiles src/core/*.lua using bin/luac as needed

	Created submodules for Lua, cjson, and lpeg
	Makefile now looks for these in the submodules directory

	Rosie is now started (launched) in a different way:
	- The ROSIE_HOME/run script has been removed
	- There is now a bin/rosie script which is generated by the Makefile
	- 'make install' links /usr/local/bin/rosie (by default) to bin/rosie
	- src/run-rosie is a script that requires a first arg which points to
	  rosie install directory (and it sets ROSIE_HOME inside rosie accordingly)

2016-08-09  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* v0.99b

	Fixed an inadvertent change to assignment semantics that
	appeared in v0.99a wherein uses of pattern a were labeled b in the
	output because a was defined as 'a=b'.  The correct behavior is for such
	matches to be labeled a.

	Introduced this CHANGELOG.

	Moved dependencies into ROSIE_HOME/tmp directory.

	Moved docker file examples into ROSIE_HOME/docker directory.
